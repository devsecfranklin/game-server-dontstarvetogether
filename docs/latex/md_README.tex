\item To play on the Dont Starve Together server, start the game on Steam, then look for the server named "{}wonderland"{}
\item Streaming live to twitch.\+tv/s1y\+\_\+b0rg
\item Clone this repo onto your game server.
\item Create a dedicated user for the game, such as {\ttfamily dst}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item make the repo clone the home directory of the new dst user.

\item We will use {\ttfamily direnv} to pick up the secret token from an environment variable.

Now create a file called {\ttfamily .envrc} in this top level folder. It should have one line in it like so\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{export CLUSTER\_TOKEN="{}pef-\/g\string^KU\_QrGp3bke\string^uerRdBrRFyKING2q9zypelrosOjFYc1g="{}}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item These will be copied into place by the scripts later.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item There is \href{saves/gen_mod_override.sh}{\texttt{ a new script}} to generate the {\ttfamily saves/modoverrides.\+lua} file.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It just got tedious recreating it by hand every time we wanted to test a new server side mod.

\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Crontab Entry}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
You can cause the gamse server to update itself at a time when you should probably be sleeping. Use the {\ttfamily crontab -\/e} command to add this line to your dst service user crontab\+:

{\ttfamily 0 4 $\ast$ $\ast$ $\ast$ /usr/games/steamcmd +login anonymous +app\+\_\+update 343050 validate +quit}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Run Scripts}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
These two scripts set up the environment and start the game server.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./bin/bootstrap.sh}
\DoxyCodeLine{./bin/run\_dedicated\_server.sh}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Troubleshooting}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Mod had no modworldgenmain.\+lua. Skipping.}\label{md_README_autotoc_md6}
That means that mod (or mods) are no longer compatible with the current version of DST; or the files have become corrupt (which can happen even if others use the same mod without issue).

You\textquotesingle{}re going to need manually remove the mods from your game files (this happens quite often). This is an easy fix!\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Turn off auto-\/subscribe, if you have it on.
\item Unsubscribe from ALL mods, that are showing \char`\"{}workshop-\/xxxxxxx\char`\"{} for you, on the Steam Workshop page.
\item Go into your \char`\"{}\+Don\textquotesingle{}t Starve Together\char`\"{} file/folder and manually delete ALL of those mods.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item manually delete ALL\+: \char`\"{}workshop-\/$<$number$>$\char`\"{} directories from your {\ttfamily steamapps\textbackslash{}common\textbackslash{}Don\textquotesingle{}t Starve Together\textbackslash{}mods} directory.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Finally, you begin the process of adding those mods back in, one at a time, until you find the one(s) causing the issue.
