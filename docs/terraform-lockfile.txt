.terraform.lock.hcl is part of Terraform’s strategy for defense against supply-chain
attacks where an attacker might somehow cause your system to install a modified version
of a provider. The checksums recorded in .terraform.lock.hcl serve to ensure that you’re
still running the same provider version you ran last time. However, there are other
mechanism in place that complement the lock file:

    Terraform verifies the certificate of the remote registry against your system’s trusted
    certificate store, preventing certain kinds of misdirection or man-in-the-middle attacks.
    If you’re using the default direct installation method then Terraform checks the downloaded
    package against a set of approved checksums signed using a signature selected by the
    registry, so an attacker would need to compromise the checksums, the signature, and the package.

If you’re running terraform validate in an isolated environment without access to any
credentials then you might conclude also that the risk of executing arbitrary untrusted
code is relatively low in this case.
