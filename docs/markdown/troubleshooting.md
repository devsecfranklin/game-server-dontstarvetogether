# Troubleshooting

## Mod had no modworldgenmain.lua. Skipping.

That means that mod (or mods) are no longer compatible with the current version of DST; or the
files have become corrupt (which can happen even if others use the same mod without issue).

You're going to need manually remove the mods from your game files (this happens quite often).
This is an easy fix!:

* Turn off auto-subscribe, if you have it on.
* Unsubscribe from ALL mods, that are showing "workshop-xxxxxxx" for you, on the Steam Workshop page.
* Go into your "Don't Starve Together" file/folder and manually delete ALL of those mods.
  * manually delete ALL: "workshop-<number>" directories from your
`steamapps\common\Don't Starve Together\mods` directory.

Finally, you begin the process of adding those mods back in, one at a time, until you
find the one(s) causing the issue.
