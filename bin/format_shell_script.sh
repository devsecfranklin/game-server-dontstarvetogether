# This script formats shell scripts using shfmt, ensuring consistent style.
# It checks for shfmt installation, installs it if missing, and then
# applies formatting to specified files and directories.

# Enable strict mode for robust scripting:
# -e: Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
# -u: Treat unset variables as an error.
# -o pipefail: The return value of a pipeline is the status of the last command
#              to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit
#              successfully.

YELLOW='\033[1;33m' # Yellow text
NC='\033[0m'        # No Color - resets text color
